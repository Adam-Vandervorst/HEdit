# H-Edit
This is an editor for H's, T's, and (rich) graphs.

Opening `view.html` with a web browser starts the application.\
Some utilities for processing the save files can be found in `utils.py`.   
A relatively up-to-date version is hosted at https://apps.adamv.be/HEdit/ ([example](https://apps.adamv.be/HEdit/?uri=/static/Hs/GPT3CompletionDAG.json&hide_gray&selected=[0]&hide_help)).

Please refer to https://research.adamv.be/ for a brief introduction of H's and T's.
